Our intelligent widgets help you further filter down results of your search and get to the right people as quickly as possible.

        <p>We understand your profile information is valuable and keep most of your information private by default. You can choose who views what part of your profile conveniently. All the data in our system is secured using industry standard security protocols just so you can sleep peacefully and know nobody without the right authority gets access to you. For example, you can choose to make your email ID visible to all alumni but mobile number visible only to your classmates.</p>

        </div>
        <p>Every user on the system will have communication privileges based on his role with the college. For example, an alumni chapter president can email all alumni in his chapter but the same cannot be done by other alumni. Similarly, an alumni can email a group of his batchmates but cannot email a group of alumni from another batch without additional privileges. These rules can easily be configured to suit the needs. We also allow you to mark emails as spam and have rules to eliminate or decrease emails from the same people.</p>
