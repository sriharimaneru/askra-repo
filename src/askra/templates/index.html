        </div>
        <p>
           Search people based on name, year of graduation, branch, roll number, company, designation, higher education and many more criteria. For example, you can search for all alumni who have graduated from NIT Warangal in 1999 and pursued Masters from Stanford University in one search.
           <br><br>
           Our intelligent widgets help you further filter down results of your search and get to the right people as quickly as possible. Our search bar also suggests what you might be looking for as soon you start typing in.

        <p>
           Our smart data systems decrease redundancy and increase accuracy of data added by users. For example, if you add TCS as your company we know that people who work at Tata Consultancy Services are your colleagues. 
           <br><br>
           While adding information to your profile, we suggest relevant data to make it easier for you. The system gets smarter as more and more information gets added.

        </div>
        <p>
           We understand your profile information is valuable and keep most of it private by default. You can choose who views what part of your profile conveniently. For example, you can choose to make your email ID visible to all alumni but mobile number visible only to your classmates.
           <br><br>
           All the data in our system is secured using industry standard security protocols just so you can stay assured that nobody without the right authority gets access to you.

        </div>
        <p>
           Every user on the system will have communication privileges based on his role with the college. For example, an alumni chapter president can email all alumni in his chapter but the same cannot be done by other alumni. Similarly, an alumni can email a group of his batchmates but cannot email a group of alumni from another batch without additional privileges.
           <br><br>
           These rules can easily be configured to suit the needs. We also allow you to mark emails as spam and have rules to eliminate or decrease emails from the same people.
